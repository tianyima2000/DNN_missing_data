This project contains code for the simulations in the paper Deep learning with missing data, and a tutorial on how to implement and train Pattern Embedded Neural Networks (PENNs).

# Tutorial
The complete code used in this tutorial can be found in the file Tutorial.ipynb. Here, we only focus on how to define the class of PENNs and how to train them. The required packages for this tutorial are `torch`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn`.
